# function: did_encode

The `did_encode` function transforms Terraform values into hex-encoded candid values. It takes a single argument and applies heuristics to generate a candid value.
For primitive values (strings, etc) will be encoded as the equivalent candid type. HCL maps and objects will be encoded as records unless they contain the fields `__didType` or `__didValue`. When those fields are set, `__didValue` is the actual value to be encoded, and `__didType` must be a tag defining the type of the value. These fields however should be treated as implementation details and the various helpers (`did_text`, `did_record`) should be used instead.

Here are some equivalences between HCL values and textual candid value:

`"hello"` = `("hello")`
`{ foo = "bar" }` = `(record { foo = "bar" })`
