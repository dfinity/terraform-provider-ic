# IC Provider

The "ic" provider can create and manage [canisters](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/concepts/canisters-code) (smart contracts) on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org).

```terraform
resource "ic_canister" "hello_world" {

    wasm_file = "${path.root}/hello-world.wasm"

    arg = { greeter = "Hi" }

    controllers = [ "fgte5-ciaaa-aaaad-aaatq-cai" ]
}
```


## Basic Usage

Create a `main.tf` file:

```terraform
# main.tf

# Declare the provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    ic = { source = "dfinity/ic" }
  }
}

# Example IC provider configuration for a single canister
provider "ic" {
  # NOTE: check port against output of `dfx info webserver-port`
  endpoint = "http://localhost:4943"
}

# Create an empty canister
resource "ic_canister" "my-canister" {}
```

Tell terraform to download the provider etc:

```bash
terraform init
```

The provider is installed. Deploy the canister:

```bash
terraform apply
```

The canister was created. Now destroy:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

The canister was destroyed.
